# 🌟 100 Days of DSA — Consistency, Discipline & Growth

**By Gungun Juneja**

Welcome to my 100 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms journey. This is my commitment to showing up daily, learning from the basics, and building strong problem-solving skills.

---

## 🚀 Why I Started

I wanted to:
* Remove the fear of complex problems
* Build a consistent coding routine
* Stop waiting for the "perfect time"

So I committed publicly to:

✔ 1 problem every day  
✔ 1 concept every day  
✔ 1 improvement every day  
✔ For 100 days

Documenting it publicly keeps me accountable and creates a transparent learning path for beginners like me.
